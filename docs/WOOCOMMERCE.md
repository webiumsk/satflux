# WooCommerce integration

SATFLUX WooCommerce plugin connects WordPress shops to [satflux.io](https://satflux.io) for BTCPay payments, optional business invoicing, and optional Satflux Tickets.

## Architecture

```
WooCommerce (SATFLUX plugin)
  ├─ Connect (session) → GET /woocommerce/connect
  ├─ Payment → BTCPay Greenfield API (store API key)
  ├─ Invoicing (Pro+) → /api/integrations/woocommerce/*
  └─ Tickets (optional) → BTCPay SatoshiTickets API
```

## Connect flow

1. Merchant opens **WooCommerce → Satflux → Connection** and clicks **Connect to Satflux.io**.
2. Browser redirects to `GET /woocommerce/connect?return_url=...` (HTTPS required, user must be logged in).
3. Satflux redirects back with:
   - `btcpay_url`, `api_key`, `store_id` (BTCPay GUID)
   - `satflux_store_id`, `satflux_company_id` (when linked)
   - `integration_token`, `integration_secret` (for invoicing API + webhooks)
   - `invoicing_enabled=0|1`

Canonical connect URL is `/woocommerce/satflux-tickets/connect`; the legacy `/woocommerce/satoshi-tickets/connect` remains supported for plugins in the field.

## Integration API (invoicing)

Auth: `Authorization: Bearer {integration_token}`

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/integrations/woocommerce/connection` | Test + store/company info, inbox deep link paths |
| POST | `/api/integrations/woocommerce/contacts/upsert` | Upsert buyer contact |
| POST | `/api/integrations/woocommerce/documents` | Create draft from WC order |
| POST | `/api/integrations/woocommerce/documents/{id}/issue` | Issue document |
| GET | `/api/integrations/woocommerce/documents/{id}` | Status, PDF URL, pay link |

Rate limit: 60 requests/minute per IP.

Document reads and issuance require both the integration's store and its linked company to match the server document. Another store's document is rejected with 404 even when both stores share a company; documents without a store are also rejected. Local-first inbox entries and PDF downloads are scoped to the integration ID.

## Webhooks to WooCommerce

When a business document linked to a WooCommerce order is marked paid, Satflux POSTs to:

`{site}/wp-json/satflux/v1/invoicing-webhook`

Header: `X-Satflux-Signature: HMAC-SHA256(body, integration_secret)`

Payload: `{ "event": "document.paid", "document_id", "woocommerce_order_id", ... }`

BTCPay payment webhooks for shop orders use:

`{site}/wp-json/satflux/v1/webhook` (event `InvoiceSettled`)

## Integration inbox (local-first)

WooCommerce orders can enqueue to `integration_document_inbox` instead of server `business_documents`.

**Merchant UI:** Invoicing → company → **Invoices** → WooCommerce inbox panel (requires `runs_eshop` in company app settings and linked store).

**Deep link from WooCommerce plugin:**

`https://satflux.io/invoicing/stores/{satflux_store_uuid}/integration-inbox`

- `{satflux_store_uuid}` is `stores.id` (Laravel UUID), **not** the BTCPay store id.
- Legacy links with BTCPay store id still resolve via `GET /api/invoicing/integration-inbox/deeplink?store=...`.
- The SPA landing route redirects to the invoice list and scrolls to the inbox panel.

**Connect callback** must include `satflux_store_id` (`return_satflux_store_id=1` on connect URL). Plugin should persist `data.store.id` from `GET /api/integrations/woocommerce/connection` after connect.

## Data model

- `store_integrations` - per-store WooCommerce token (hashed), encrypted secret, webhook URL
- Business documents from WooCommerce store `internal_note`: `woocommerce_order_id={id}`

## Plan requirements

- **Payment only:** any Satflux store with BTCPay credentials
- **Invoicing:** Pro/Enterprise `business_invoicing` + company linked to store (`stores.company_id`)
- **Tickets:** Satflux Tickets plugin (fork of Satoshi Tickets) on the merchant's BTCPay Server

## Upgrade from v1.x (BTCPay Satoshi Tickets plugin era)

Plugin v2.0 migrates `btcpay_satoshi_*` options to `satflux_*`, keeps ticket gateway ID for existing orders, and auto-enables Tickets module when ticket products exist.
