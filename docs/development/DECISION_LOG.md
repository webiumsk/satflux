# Development decision log

This log starts with the current bootstrap. It does not reconstruct undocumented
historical decisions. Product history is linked from PROJECT_STATE with source evidence.

## 2026-10-13: project-local orchestration

Status: authorized setup decision from the Product Owner's bootstrap request.
Main remains the PM/technical lead/orchestrator and owns shared state and publication.
Specialists have bounded ownership and independent security/QA review. Ten roles live
in `.codex/agents/`, reusable skills in `.agents/skills/`, portable registry in workspace/.
Keep existing Claude/Cursor/CI/security conventions; record contradictions explicitly.
External repositories remain read-only during setup. No global settings are changed.

## 2026-10-13: conservative concurrency and inherited settings

Status: bootstrap implementation choice, validated against CLI 0.162.1.
Set `max_concurrent_threads_per_session` to 3 because the supported key counts spawned
threads excluding main. This yields four simultaneous agents total, matching current
runtime capacity. Inherit model/reasoning/provider/approval settings; security, QA and
researcher default read-only. Live runtime permissions remain authoritative.

## 2026-10-13: independent repositories and version evidence

Status: authorized workspace constraint.
Keep separate histories/PRs/tests/releases. Use relative/env-configurable paths, verify
remotes, and distinguish stale checkout, fresh PR status and unverified deployment.
Do not create a monorepo, submodules, speculative relay repository or external edits.
Treat the NBDP workflow as reference, adapting ownership and trust boundaries to
Satflux rather than copying protocol-specific instructions or local Git workarounds.

## 2026-10-13: temporarily free PRO

Status: PROPOSED, NOT AUTHORIZED FOR IMPLEMENTATION.
Preferred architecture is a centralized reversible promotional entitlement policy,
separate from billing, security authorization, administrative privilege and limits.
The next task is a read-only multi-agent audit. Eligibility, promotion end/data access,
costs, quotas, existing subscriber behavior and rollout require Product Owner decisions.
Do not create subscriptions, cancel recurring payments or grant Enterprise/admin rights.

## Publication follow-up: owner clarification and authorization

Status: authorized orchestration publication only. Create a dedicated Satflux branch,
commit only prepared orchestration files, push to the owned repository and open a PR
to verified default branch `master`. Do not merge, deploy, change product code or
write to sibling repositories. Do not start the free-PRO audit in this step.

The Product Owner reports ZERO paying subscribers and intends promotional PRO access
for eligible registered users. This statement is not a verified production billing
finding. The future audit should use available non-production evidence only and
document its limitations. Existing paid-customer migration/refunds/communications
are not required under the stated assumption; revisit only if evidence contradicts it.
Prioritize centralized reversible entitlements, disabling new PRO purchases and
upgrade prompts during promotion, preserving billing for future monetization,
unchanged authorization/isolation/security and a safe return to paid plans.
Implementation remains NOT AUTHORIZED.

## 2026-10-14: SATFLUX-001 policy decisions and SATFLUX-002 authorization

Status: explicit Product Owner approval for bounded Satflux implementation, tests,
localization and documentation following the read-only audit. No external repository
writes, push, merge, deployment, production billing/configuration change or activation
is authorized. Historical audit-only instructions are superseded only within this
approved source/test scope.

Approved eligibility is non-guest plus verified email. Duration is indefinite.
Use current PRO quotas, retain over-limit objects and existing purchased allowances.
Existing manual PRO retains its current validity; no permanent grant or provenance
migration was approved. Pause all new PRO/trial/PRO-credit purchases, company slots
and ISDOC packs. Enterprise and administrative privileges remain unchanged.
No paying subscribers or in-flight payments exist according to the owner; production
records were neither accessed nor changed to verify those statements.

Implement effective access separately from factual billing with an explicit PRO
feature allowlist, preserving Enterprise exclusion, tenant/company-owner checks,
guest/verification restrictions and existing fulfillment/reconciliation. Promotion
defaults off; purchase flags default closed independently. No subscription, role,
email verification, trial usage or balance is manufactured by promotional access.

Source implementation passed independent security/QA review and full validation
recorded in PROJECT_STATE. Targeted fixes preserve numbered WooCommerce completion,
owner/member isolation, fresh verified local writes and actual-provider Enterprise
credit behavior. PHPStan debt was reduced without adding suppressions.

Release prerequisite: Satflux purchase guards alone cannot close direct BTCPay sales,
funding portals or prefunded AutoRenew. Verify the exact deployed provider and a
PRO-only closure before activation; plan deletion or subscription cancellation is
not authorized. Hosted-relay costs and rollout propagation also require readiness
evidence. Future notice/data-access policy, permanent manual grants and paid reopening
remain separate owner decisions. Next milestone is SATFLUX-003 readiness.
